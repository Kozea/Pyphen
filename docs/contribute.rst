You want to add some code to Pyphen, launch its tests or improve its
documentation? Thank you very much! Here are some tips to help you play with
Pyphen in good conditions.

The first step is to clone the repository, create a virtual environment and
install Pyphen dependencies.

.. code-block:: shell

   git clone https://github.com/CourtBouillon/pyphen.git
   cd pyphen
   python -m venv venv
   venv/bin/pip install -e .[doc,test]

You can then launch Python to test your changes.

.. code-block:: shell

   venv/bin/python

Tests
-----

Tests are stored in the ``tests`` folder at the top of the repository. They use
the pytest_ library.

You can launch tests (with code coverage and lint) using the following command::

  venv/bin/pytest

.. _pytest: https://docs.pytest.org/


Documentation
-------------

Documentation is stored in the ``docs`` folder at the top of the repository. It
relies on the Sphinx_ library.

You can build the documentation using the following command::

  venv/bin/sphinx-build docs docs/_build

The documentation home page can now be found in the ``docs/_build/index.html``
file. You can open this file in a browser to see the final rendering.
